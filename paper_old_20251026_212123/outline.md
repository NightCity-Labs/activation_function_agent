# Paper Outline: Learning Optimal Activation Functions via Correlation Objectives

**Main Contribution**: Deriving optimal activation functions from first principles using correlation-based objectives, showing that the widely-used Swish activation emerges naturally from Gaussian mixture statistics.

---

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Statement
- Neural networks rely on hand-picked activation functions (ReLU, Swish, GELU)
- These choices are motivated by heuristics rather than principled optimization
- **Key question**: Can we derive optimal activations from the data and task?

### Main Contribution
- A correlation-based objective for learning activation functions
- Theoretical framework for Gaussian mixture classification
- Proof that Swish emerges as optimal solution for moderate class separation
- Empirical validation on CIFAR-10 with VGG and ResNet architectures

### Key Results Preview
- Two-class case: ReLU-like shape emerges from correlation objective
- Multi-class case: Swish-like activations (*x·σ(βx)*) are optimal for mid-range σ
- Neural networks trained with learnable activations converge to swish
- Both backprop and local correlation training discover the same shapes

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Theoretical Framework

**Correlation Objective**:
- Define class-wise correlation: ρₖ = Corr(f(x), 1[y=k])
- Zero-sum constraint: Σₖ ρₖ = 0 (natural competition between classes)
- Signed objective: minimize negative correlations, maximize positive correlations
- Normalization: Var(f(x)) = 1

**Gaussian Mixture Setting**:
- K classes with Gaussian distributions
- Means μₖ evenly spaced, equal variances σ², equal priors
- Parameterize f(x) as piecewise-linear with N knots
- Two training modes: sample-based (Monte Carlo) and analytic (closed-form integrals)

**Mathematical Analysis**:
- Decomposition: f(x) as integral of ρ(x)
- Negative part: exponential decay with self-consistency
- Positive part: linear ramp (maximizing energy under budget constraint)
- Connection to swish: smooth gating emerges from sigmoid-like ρ(x)

### 2.2 Experimental Setup

**Unit-Level Experiments**:
- Gaussian mixture classification (K=2 to 20 classes)
- Sigma sweeps: small (0.6), mid (1.0), large (10.0)
- Analytic vs. sample-based training comparison
- Swish family fitting to extract parameters (β, x₀)

**Neural Network Experiments**:
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 32×32 RGB)
- Architectures: VGG-11/13/16, ResNet-10/18
- Learnable activation: PiecewiseLinearActivation (33 knots, [-3, 3])
- Two training modes:
  - **Backprop**: Standard cross-entropy, end-to-end optimization
  - **Local**: Backbone via CE, activations via correlation objective
- WandB logging: loss, accuracy, activation snapshots, histograms

**Implementation Details**:
- Piecewise-linear activation with fast vectorized interpolation
- Post-step projection: anchor left knot to zero, L2-normalize
- Pre-activation blocks for ResNet (BN → PWL → Conv)
- Decoupled learning rates: backbone (1e-3), activations (1e-2)
- Batch normalization provides near-Gaussian pre-activation statistics

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Unit-Level Findings

**Two-Class Case (K=2)**:
- ReLU-like shape emerges
- Near-zero for negative inputs, linear for positive inputs
- Surprising: not sigmoid/Heaviside as expected for binary classification
- Reason: zero-sum constraint creates threshold detector

**Multi-Class Case (K=20, σ=1.0)**:
- Swish-like activation emerges
- Smooth transition at x ≈ 0
- Fits well to f(x) = x·σ(2.5x)
- Negative ρₖ for low classes, positive ρₖ for high classes

**Sigma Regime Analysis**:
- **Small σ (0.6)**: Sharp, selective activations
- **Mid σ (1.0)**: Smooth swish with sigmoid gating
- **Large σ (10.0)**: Broad, nearly linear with smooth threshold
- Shape adapts to input statistics (class separation)

**Analytic vs. Sample Training**:
- Both converge to identical shapes
- Analytic training is faster (closed-form integrals)
- Validates gradient implementation

### 3.2 Neural Network Results

**VGG-11 Backprop (20 epochs)**:
- Learned activations converge to swish-like shapes
- All layers develop smooth sigmoid gating
- Test accuracy: ~88% (comparable to ReLU baseline)
- Activation evolution: linear → sigmoid gating → stable swish

**ResNet-10 Backprop (20 epochs)**:
- Cleaner activation shapes than VGG
- Faster convergence with pre-activation blocks
- Test accuracy: ~90%
- Per-layer variation observed (see below)

**Layer-Wise Variation**:
- Early layers (0-2): Broad, smooth swish (β ≈ 1.5)
- Mid layers (3-6): Steeper slopes (β ≈ 2.5)
- Late layers (7-9): Nearly ReLU (linear for positive, near-zero for negative)
- Reason: later layers have better features, need less nonlinearity

**Histogram Analysis**:
- Pre-activation distributions are approximately Gaussian
- Batch normalization enforces near-Gaussian statistics
- Per-class means separated, equal variances observed
- Validates Gaussian mixture assumption

### 3.3 Theoretical Validation

**Swish as Optimal Solution**:
- Mid-range σ: swish minimizes signed correlation objective
- f(x) = x·σ(βx) emerges from ρ(x) decomposition
- Smooth gating (sigmoid) + linear scaling
- Not hand-designed—derived from first principles

**Backprop vs. Correlation**:
- Both training modes converge to similar shapes
- Cross-entropy gradient approximates correlation objective
- When: Gaussian pre-activations, moderate separation
- Validates that backprop implicitly optimizes correlation

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Interpretation

**Why Swish Emerges**:
- Zero-sum constraint creates competition between classes
- Sigmoid gating provides smooth, differentiable threshold
- Linear scaling preserves gradient flow in deep networks
- Optimal under Gaussian statistics with moderate overlap

**Connection to Existing Activations**:
- Swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017): discovered via NAS
- Our work: derived from correlation objective
- GELU: similar shape, different motivation (Gaussian CDF)
- ReLU: special case for two classes or well-separated data

**Biological Plausibility**:
- Correlation learning related to Hebbian rules
- Local objective (per-unit optimization)
- No backpropagation required for activation learning
- Potential model for biological learning

### 4.2 Limitations

**Theoretical Assumptions**:
- Gaussian mixture model may not hold for all tasks
- Equal variance assumption simplifies but restricts
- Piecewise-linear parameterization limits expressiveness
- Single-unit analysis doesn't capture multi-unit interactions

**Experimental Scope**:
- CIFAR-10 only (need ImageNet, other domains)
- Limited architectures (VGG, ResNet variants)
- No comparison to other learnable activation methods
- Local correlation training needs further stabilization

**Computational Considerations**:
- Memory scales with knot_count × batch_size × channels
- Analytic training not applicable to real neural network data
- Per-unit mode can be memory-intensive for large models

### 4.3 Future Work

**Theoretical Extensions**:
- Non-Gaussian input distributions (Laplace, heavy-tailed)
- Multi-unit correlation objectives (capture dependencies)
- Connection to information theory (mutual information maximization)
- Formal proof of swish optimality under general conditions

**Experimental Directions**:
- Scale to ImageNet and other vision benchmarks
- Apply to language models (BERT, GPT architectures)
- Ablation studies: knot count, regularization strength, σ regimes
- Compare to NAS-discovered activations (Mish, FReLU, etc.)
- Transfer learned activations across tasks

**Applications**:
- Meta-learning: learn activation priors from multiple tasks
- Neural architecture search: co-optimize architecture and activations
- Efficient training: use correlation objective to pre-train activations
- Biological modeling: test correlation-based learning in neuroscience
