FIGURE 1: Theoretical Framework
Filename: fig1.png
Source: analytic_smoke.png
Caption: Optimal activation function f(x) and class-wise correlations ρₖ for K=20 
         Gaussian mixture (σ=1.0). Swish-like shape emerges with smooth transition 
         at x=0.
Section: Methods (2.1)
Format: PNG

================================================================================

FIGURE 2: Two-Class Case
Filename: fig2.png
Source: analytic_2classes.png
Caption: ReLU-like activation emerges for binary classification (K=2). Near-zero 
         for negative inputs, linear for positive inputs.
Section: Results (3.1)
Format: PNG

================================================================================

FIGURE 3: Sigma Regime Comparison
Filename: fig3.png
Source: compare_sigs.png
Caption: Optimal activations across different sigma regimes. Small σ: sharp and 
         selective; mid σ: smooth swish; large σ: broad and linear.
Section: Results (3.1)
Format: PNG

================================================================================

FIGURE 4: Swish Fit Quality
Filename: fig4.png
Source: analytic_smoke_swish_fit_both.png
Caption: Learned activation (blue) fitted to swish family (red). Excellent match 
         with f(x) ≈ x·σ(2.5x) for mid-range σ.
Section: Results (3.1)
Format: PNG

FIGURE 5: Neural Network Activation Evolution (Multi-panel)
Filenames: fig5_layer0.png, fig5_layer3.png, fig5_layer6.png, fig5_layer7.png
Source: activations_4j06yful/activations_layer_0.png (and layers 3, 6, 7)
Caption: Learned activation functions across layers in ResNet-10 after 20 epochs. 
         All layers converge to swish-like shapes with layer-specific parameters.
         Panel layout shows layers 0, 3, 6, 7 for comparison of early, mid, and 
         late layer behavior.
Section: Results (3.2)
Format: PNG (4 separate files for multi-panel figure)
Note: Create multi-panel figure showing progression from early to late layers.
      Early layers (0-2): Broad, smooth swish (β ≈ 1.5)
      Mid layers (3-6): Steeper slopes (β ≈ 2.5)
      Late layers (7): Nearly ReLU-like (linear for positive, near-zero for negative)

================================================================================

FIGURE 6: Pre-Activation Histograms
Filename: fig6.png
Source: hists_layer_0_45eq1acn.png
Caption: Per-class pre-activation distributions for ResNet-10 layer 0. Approximately 
         Gaussian with separated means, validating theoretical assumptions.
Section: Results (3.2)
Format: PNG

================================================================================

FIGURE 7: Training Convergence
Filename: fig7.png
Source: analytic_smoke_fx_over_steps.png
Caption: Evolution of f(x) during analytic training (100 steps). Rapid convergence 
         to optimal swish-like shape.
Section: Methods (2.2) or Results (3.1)
Format: PNG

================================================================================

FIGURE 8: Rho Decomposition (Optional)
Filename: fig8.png
Source: analytic_smoke_rho_fit.png
Caption: Correlation function ρ(x) fitted to exponential (negative) + linear 
         (positive) model. Integrating ρ(x) yields f(x).
Section: Results (3.3) or Appendix
Format: PNG
Note: This figure is marked as optional in the outline. Consider for appendix if 
      main paper space is limited.

================================================================================

SUMMARY:
- Total figures: 8 main figures (Figure 5 consists of 4 sub-panels)
- Total files: 11 PNG files
- All figures successfully copied from source
- Format: PNG (LaTeX supports PNG, though PDF would be preferred for publication)
- All source files are read-only and preserved in original location

NEXT STEPS:
1. Consider converting PNG to PDF for better LaTeX/publication quality
2. Create multi-panel layout for Figure 5 (combine 4 layer images)
3. Verify figure resolution and readability
4. Update LaTeX main.tex to include figure references
