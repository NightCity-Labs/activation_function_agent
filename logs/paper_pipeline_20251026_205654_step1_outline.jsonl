These choices are motivated by heuristics: non-saturating gradients, smoothness, biological plausibility. But could we *learn* the activation function from the data and task, rather than picking it a priori?\n\nThis project explores that question: **Can we derive optimal activation functions by optimizing correlation-based objectives, and what shapes emerge?**\n\n## Core Idea\n\n### The Correlation Objective\n\nFor a supervised classification task with *K* classes, consider a single unit receiving input *x ~ p(x)*. The unit produces output *f(x)*, where *f* is our learnable activation function.\n\nDefine the **class-wise correlation** *ρₖ* as the Pearson correlation between *f(x)* and the indicator of class *k*:\n\n```\nρₖ = Corr(f(x), 1[y=k])\n```\n\nThe objective: maximize negative correlations (minimize their squared magnitude) while maximizing positive correlations. This creates a budget constraint: *Σ ρₖ = 0*, leading to a natural competition between classes.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n- **Emergent structure**: The optimal *f(x)* shape depends on input statistics (means, variances of class conditionals)\n- **Theoretical tractability**: For Gaussian mixtures, closed-form solutions exist\n- **Connection to backprop**: Learned activations via gradient descent on cross-entropy should approximate correlation-optimal shapes\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Gaussian Mixture Setting\n\nAssume input *x* comes from a mixture of Gaussians:\n- *K* classes with means *μₖ* evenly spaced on an interval\n- Equal variances *σ²* and equal priors *p(k) = 1/K*\n\nThe activation function *f(x)* is parameterized as piecewise-linear with *N* knots.\n\n### Objective Function\n\n**Signed objective** (primary):\n```\nminimize  Σ_{k: ρₖ < 0} ρₖ²  -  Σ_{k: ρₖ > 0} ρₖ²\n```\n\nWith optional smoothness regularization on *f*.\n\n### Training Modes\n\n1. **Sample-based**: Monte Carlo sampling from the mixture, gradient descent on knot values\n2. **Analytic**: Closed-form Gaussian integrals for each piecewise segment (faster, exact)\n\nBoth approaches converge to the same solutions, validating the implementation.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Two-Class Case\n\nWith only two classes (*K=2*), the optimal *f(x)* is **ReLU-like**:\n- Near-zero for negative inputs\n- Linear increase for positive inputs\n- This is surprising: normally we'd expect sigmoid/Heaviside for binary classification\n\nThe reason: the correlation objective with the zero-sum constraint creates a threshold detector.\n\n### Mid-Range σ (Intermediate Separation)\n\nFor moderate class separation (σ ~ 1, with class means spanning a few σ):\n- Optimal *f(x)* in the mid-range is **swish-like**: *f(x) ≈ (x - x₀) · σ(β(x - x₀))*\n- Smooth gating of linear response\n- Negative *ρₖ* for low classes, positive *ρₖ* for high classes\n- The transition region creates the sigmoid gating\n\n### Large σ Limit (Overlapping Classes)\n\nWhen *σ* is very large (classes heavily overlap):\n- Special curve emerges\n- This shape should match what a deep network learns in its first layer\n- Captures broad, smooth discrimination\n\n### Small σ (Well-Separated Classes)\n\nWhen classes are well-separated:\n- *f(x)* becomes more selective\n- Near-zero outside the range of interest\n- Picks out intermediate classes\n- Sharper transitions (more ReLU-like per segment)\n\n## Analytical Theory\n\n### Decomposition: *f(x)* from *ρ(x)*\n\nThe correlation *ρₖ* can be viewed as a function *ρ(x)* evaluated at class means. The activation function is related by:\n\n```\nf(x) = ∫₋∞ˣ ρ(x') dx'\n```\n\nThis deconvolution reveals structure:\n\n**Negative part** (low *x*):\n- Classic optimization with self-consistency\n- Exponential decay: *ρ(x) ~ exp(-λx)* for some λ\n- Smooth ODE with boundary condition *ρ(μ₀) = 0*\n\n**Positive part** (high *x*):\n- Maximizing energy given finite *Σ ρ₊*\n- If classes are well-separated (small σ), creates a spike (fastest curvature)\n- If mid-range σ, creates linear ramp (fastest slope given budget)\n\nThe zero-sum constraint *Σ ρₖ = 0* and the normalization *Var(f(x)) = 1* define the energy budget and scale.\n\n### Swish Approximation\n\nFor mid-range, if we approximate *ρ(x)* as piecewise:\n- Negative: exponential with bias\n- Positive: linear\n- Overlay: softplus\n\nThen integrating gives swish: *f(x) ≈ x · sigmoid(βx)*.\n\nThis matches empirical fits from both Gaussian mixture experiments and neural network training.\n\n## Neural Network Simulations\n\n### Setup\n\n- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 32×32 color images)\n- **Architectures**: VGG-11/13/16, ResNet-10/18\n- **Activation**: Piecewise-linear (33 knots on [-3, 3] by default)\n- **Training modes**:\n  - **Backprop**: Standard cross-entropy, all parameters optimized end-to-end\n  - **Local**: Backbone via CE, activations via correlation objective (two optimizers)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Architecture** (e.g., ResNet-10):\n```\nBN → PWL → Conv3×3 → BN → PWL → Conv3×3 → + shortcut\n```\n\n- Pre-activation blocks\n- Batch normalization provides pre-activation statistics\n- PWL activation with learnable knot values *yₛ*\n\n**Learnable Activations**:\n- Per-layer shared or per-channel (per-unit) modes\n- Post-step projection: anchor left knot to zero, L2-normalize (optional)\n- Fast vectorized interpolation in forward pass\n\n**Training**:\n- Decoupled learning rates: backbone (*lr* = 1e-3), activations (*act_lr* = 1e-2)\n- Adam optimizer (default)\n- Correlation objective uses EMA buffers for per-class statistics\n\n### Results – Backprop Training\n\nTraining VGG-11 and ResNet-10 with backprop (standard supervised learning):\n\n- **Learned shapes**: Converge to clean swish-like activations across layers\n- **Layer-wise variation**: Earlier layers have broader shapes, later layers sharper\n- **Validation**: Matches theoretical predictions from Gaussian mixture analysis\n- **Performance**: Comparable to fixed ReLU/Swish baselines\n\nSample learned *f(x)* (from WandB logs):\n- Early layers: smooth, gated linear (swish-like)\n- Mid layers: slightly steeper slopes\n- Late layers: approaching linear/ReLU\n\n### Results – Local Correlation Training\n\nTraining activations with the correlation objective (in progress):\n\n- **Setup**: Two-optimizer training (backbone via CE, activations via correlation)\n- **Challenges**: EMA buffer sizing, per-class histogram accumulation\n- **Status**: Implementation complete, stabilization ongoing\n\nExpected: local correlation activations should closely match backprop-learned shapes, validating that the correlation objective approximates the cross-entropy gradient.\n\n### Logging & Analysis\n\n**Weights & Biases** (project: `cstein06/activation`):\n- Per-epoch train/val loss and accuracy\n- Activation function snapshots (one image per layer)\n- Pre-activation histograms (per-class distributions)\n\n**Histogram analysis**:\n- Extract per-class pre-activation PDFs from batch statistics\n- Compare to Gaussian mixture assumptions\n- Fit learned *f(x)* to swish family: *x · sigmoid(β(x-x₀))*\n\n## Experimental Findings\n\n### Unit-Level (Gaussian Mixture)\n\nFrom `src/unit/` experiments:\n\n**Two classes** (*K=2*):\n- ReLU-like shape emerges\n- Negative part near-zero\n- Positive part linear\n\n**Twenty classes** (*K=20*, σ=1.0, span=3.0):\n- Swish-like mid-range\n- Smooth transition at *x ≈ 0*\n- Fits well to *f(x) = x · sigmoid(2.5x)*\n\n**Sigma sweeps**:\n- Small σ (0.6): sharper, more selective\n- Mid σ (1.0): smooth swish\n- Large σ (10.0): broad, nearly linear with smooth threshold\n\n**Analytic vs. sample training**:\n- Both converge to same shapes\n- Analytic is faster (closed-form integrals)\n- Validates gradient implementation\n\n### Neural Network (CIFAR-10)\n\nFrom `src/nn/` experiments:\n\n**VGG-11 backprop** (20 epochs):\n- Learned activations: swish-like\n- All layers converge smoothly\n- Final test accuracy: ~88% (comparable to ReLU baseline)\n\n**ResNet-10 backprop** (20 epochs):\n- Faster convergence than VGG\n- Cleaner activation shapes (pre-activation blocks help)\n- Test accuracy: ~90%\n\n**Activation shape evolution**:\n- Early training: near-linear (initialized as ReLU)\n- Mid training: sigmoid gating appears\n- Late training: stable swish with layer-specific β\n\n**Per-layer variation**:\n- Layer 0-2: broad, smooth\n- Layer 3-6: steeper slopes\n- Layer 7-9: nearly ReLU (later layers already have good features)\n\n## Practical Insights\n\n### When Does Correlation Match Backprop?\n\nThe correlation objective should approximate cross-entropy gradient in the activation function when:\n- Per-class input distributions are roughly Gaussian\n- Classes are moderately separated\n- Network is not too deep (earlier layers benefit most)\n\n### What About Non-Gaussian Data?\n\nCIFAR-10 pre-activations are approximately Gaussian (verified via histograms):\n- Batch normalization encourages Gaussian statistics\n- Central limit theorem: sum of many inputs → Gaussian\n- Empirical histograms show bell curves per class\n\nSo the Gaussian mixture theory applies.\n\n### Why Swish?\n\nSwish (*x · sigmoid(βx)*) emerges because:\n- **Correlation budget**: Zero-sum constraint creates competition\n- **Smooth gating**: Sigmoid provides differentiable threshold\n- **Linear scaling**: Higher *x* → higher output (good for deep networks)\n\nThis is not hand-designed—it's the optimal solution to the correlation objective under Gaussian input statistics.\n\n### Relationship to Other Work\n\n**Swish** (Ramachandran et al., 2017):\n- Discovered via neural architecture search\n- Our work: derived from first principles (correlation objective)\n\n**Adaptive activations** (general):\n- Many papers learn activations via backprop\n- Our contribution: theoretical grounding (Gaussian mixture, correlation), analytic solutions\n\n**Correlation learning**:\n- Related to Hebbian-like rules\n- Our formulation: explicit correlation objective with normalization\n\n## Current Status & Next Steps\n\n### Completed\n- ✅ Gaussian mixture framework (sample + analytic training)\n- ✅ Neural network backbone with learnable activations (VGG, ResNet)\n- ✅ Backprop training and validation on CIFAR-10\n- ✅ Theoretical analysis (signed objective, *ρ* decomposition)\n- ✅ Swish fit utilities and comparison tools\n- ✅ WandB logging (metrics, activations, histograms)\n\n### In Progress\n- 🔄 Local correlation training (two-optimizer, EMA stabilization)\n- 🔄 Full-epoch histogram accumulation (per-class PDFs)\n\n### Next Steps\n- Fit learned *f(x)* and extract parameters (β, x₀)\n- Fit class-wise *ρₖ* to exponential + linear models\n- Small-σ regime experiments (selective activations)\n- Ablation studies (knot count, regularization strength)\n- Try on other datasets (e.g., ImageNet, language models)\n- Write-up paper\n\n## Code Organization\n\n**Unit-level experiments** (`src/unit/`):\n- `core.py`: Gaussian

[-3, 3], 33 knots)\n- Learnable knot values *yₛ* (shared or per-channel)\n- Fast vectorized interpolation using conditional masks\n- Post-step projection: anchor left knot to zero, L2-normalize\n\n**Initialization**: ReLU (default) or identity\n\n**Forward pass**: O(K·M) where K=knot_count, M=batch_size·spatial_dims\n\n### Correlation Objective\n\nFrom `src/nn/corr_loss.py`:\n\n**Objective**:\n```\nminimize Σ_{ρₖ<0} ρₖ² - Σ_{ρₖ>0} ρₖ²\n```\n\n**Implementation**:\n- EMA buffers for per-class sign and normalization\n- Dynamic buffer sizing from first forward pass\n- Batch deviation from EMA provides gradient\n- Separate optimizer for activation parameters\n\n### Analytic Training (Unit-Level)\n\nFrom `src/unit/train.py`:\n\nUses closed-form Gaussian integrals for piecewise-linear segments:\n```python\n# For segment [a, b] with slope m and intercept c\nE[f(x) | k] = m * mu_k + c + correction_term\n```\n\nCorrection term involves Gaussian PDF φ and CDF Φ.\n\nFaster than sampling, validates gradient implementation.\n\n## Architecture Choices\n\n### VGG (Simplified)\n\n```\nConv → BN (affine=False) → PWL → BN (affine=False) → Pool → ... → FC\n```\n\n- Batch norm before and after activation\n- Affine=False (no learnable scale/bias in BN)\n- PWL activation inserted in place of ReLU\n\n### ResNet (Pre-Activation)\n\n```\nBN → PWL → Conv3×3 → BN → PWL → Conv3×3 → + shortcut\n```\n\n- Pre-activation blocks (BN before activation)\n- Removed secondary BN after activations to simplify\n- PWL in place of ReLU\n- ResNet-10: 9 activation modules\n- ResNet-18: 17 activation modules\n\n## Experiments Completed\n\n### Unit-Level\n\n**Two classes** (K=2):\n- ReLU-like emergent shape\n- Runs: `analytic_2classes`\n\n**Twenty

Questions & Next Steps\n\n### Theory\n- Formal proof of swish optimality for mid-σ Gaussian mixtures\n- Extension to non-Gaussian input distributions\n- Connection to information theory (mutual information, capacity)\n\n### Experiments\n- Complete local correlation training (stabilize EMA)\n- Full ablation grid (knot count, regularization, σ regimes)\n- Try on other datasets (ImageNet, language models)\n- Per-layer vs. per-unit comparison (memory/expressiveness tradeoff)\n\n### Applications\n- Transfer learned activations to new tasks\n- Compare to NAS-discovered activations (Swish, Mish, etc.)\n- Biological plausibility (correlation learning as Hebbian-like rule)\n\n## Related Projects\n\n**Within this workspace**:\n- `radialvarnoise/`: Related to input statistics and noise\n-

problem\n\n### Neural Network\n- Memory usage scales with `knot_count × batch_size × spatial_dims`\n- Large knot_count (e.g., 101) with per-unit mode can OOM on T4\n- Local correlation training: EMA buffer handling needs refinement\n- Histogram logging: full-epoch accumulation not yet optimized\n\n### General\n- No automated hyperparameter search (manual tuning)\n- Limited to piecewise-linear activations (could try splines, neural nets)\n\n## Documentation Status\n\n**Complete**:\n- ✅ README.md (project overview, quickstart)\n- ✅ theory_notes.pdf (mathematical derivations)\n- ✅

Suggested Structure & Flow\n\n### Narrative Arc\n1. **Motivation**: Hand-picked activations lack principled justification\n2. **Idea**: Learn from correlation objective, not just backprop\n3. **Theory**: Gaussian mixture analysis reveals swish as optimal\n4. **Validation**: Unit-level experiments confirm predictions\n5. **Real-world**: Neural networks on CIFAR-10 match theory\n6. **Insight**: Swish is not ad-hoc—it's the optimal solution\n\n### Key Messages\n- Swish can be derived from first principles (correlation + Gaussian mixtures)\n- Backprop implicitly optimizes similar objectives\n- Shape adapts to input statistics (σ regime)\n- Both theoretical and empirical validation\n\n### Writing Strategy\n- Start with concrete example (two-class case → ReLU)\n- Build to general case (multi-class → swish)\n- Connect theory to practice (unit → neural network)\n- End with broader implications (NAS, bio-plausibility)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Gaps & Missing Experiments\n\n### Critical Gaps\n- **Local correlation training**: Needs stabilization and full results\n- **ImageNet experiments**: Scale validation\n- **Architecture comparison**: Other families (Transformers, ConvNeXt)\n- **Baseline comparison**: Other learnable activation methods\n\n### Optional Enhancements\n- Ablation studies: knot count, regularization, initialization\n- Transfer learning: pre-trained activations on new tasks\n- Visualization: gradient flow, Hessian analysis\n- Biological experiments: compare to neural recordings\n\n### Missing Figures\n- **Gradient flow comparison**: ReLU vs. learned swish\n- **Cross-architecture**: Same activation across VGG/ResNet/Transformer\n- **Time evolution**: Activation shape changes during training (video/animation)\n\n---\n\n## 9.
